On the other side is Flutter, a project started by Google which they have been heavily promoting since I/O 2017. Both of these technologies help app developers build cross-platform apps faster by using a single programming language.\n\nReact Native is already a mature tool and has a huge community. At the same time, Flutter has also started seeing huge adoption rates since 2017.\n\nIn this post, we will compare each of them using ten criteria:\n\n- Programming language\n- Technical architecture\n- Installation\n- Setup and project configuration\n- UI components and development API\n- Developer productivity\n- Community support\n- Testing support\n- Build & release automation support\n- DevOps and CI/CD support\n- Now that we have defined all our criteria, let us start exploring each of them in detail.\n\n## 1.
